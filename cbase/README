cbase is a C library of useful functions that simplify systems software
development on System V UNIX. The library includes routines for memory
management, string parsing, filesystem traversal, subprocess execution,
I/O, as well as implementations of common data structures such as linked
lists, hash tables, stacks, and queues. The library also includes a high-
level interface to Berkeley sockets, and an implementation of a scheduler
which has functionality very similar to that of the cron daemon.
Note: cbase was formerly known as CFL.
