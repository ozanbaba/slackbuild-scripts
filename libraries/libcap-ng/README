The libcap-ng library is intended to make programming with posix
capabilities much easier than the traditional libcap library. It includes
utilities that can analyse all currently running applications, print
out any capabilities and whether or not it has an open ended bounding set.

The included utilities are designed to let admins and developers spot apps
in various ways that may be running with too much privilege.

As of the 0.6 release, libcap-ng includes python bindings.  If you do not
want to build them, pass WITH_PYTHON=no when running the build script.
