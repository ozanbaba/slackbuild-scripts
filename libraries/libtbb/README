IntelÂ® Threading Building Blocks (TBB) offers a rich and complete
approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library
that helps you take advantage of multi-core processor performance
without having to be a threading expert. Threading Building Blocks is
not just a threads-replacement library. It represents a higher-level,
task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading
mechanisms for scalability and performance.

Note: This library is only supported on Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4, Itanium(R), 
Non Intel(R) processors compatible with the above processors.
