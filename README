This repo consists of following build scripts:

boncuk/ SBo script for boncuk Turkish-English Dictionrary.

ibus-antly/ SBo script for ibus-anthy, ibus module for anthy

wine/ Modified version of RWorkman's wine SBo script for building 
	wine-git tree for both 32bit and 64bit. there's a script for 
        building  wine32 and wine64 togetter to run both 32bit and 
        64bit programs called wow64.SlackBuilds. New rewriten from 
	scratch version of the wow64.SlackBuild will create one wine64
	package same as one that can be built with wine64.SlackBuild and 
	wine-compat32 package which lacks wineserver. wine-compat32 as 
	name suggests is for 64 bit multilib systems with wine64 installed.
	If there's a call for it, I'll create a seperate script for compat32
	building.

prelink/ prelink build script which Wine needs. However it's not a hard dependence

all scripts follow default build process of SBo exept wine.SlackBuilds
uses user parameters and ownership revert of the source tree.
