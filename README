This repo is for my SlackBuild scripts. It includes scripts for my SlackBuilds.org
scripts and some other scripts that I will never submit to SBo for different reasons.

Directory structure is similar to SBo repo structure. One important difference is
Oz directory. It homes my non-SBo scripts. submit directory is for will-be--submited
scripts.
