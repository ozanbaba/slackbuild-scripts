Xvidenc is a shell script which makes it easy to encode DVDs, (S)VCDs
or video files to the Xvid video format using MEncoder from the MPlayer
project. 

It needs a MEncoder complied agaist xvid. Default Slackware does not 
suply one. One can bulid it using alinBOB's MPlayer Build script while 
xvid is installed.
