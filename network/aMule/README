aMule is a multiplatform ed2k client, fork of the eMule client, using the
wxWidgets class library. It was originally forked from the xMule project,
which in turn was forked from the lMule project. This is turn was the
first fork of eMule to run nativly on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

This requires wxPython/wxGTK and cryptopp.

You can build optimal features of aMule with following variables;

DAEMON=yes Creates amuled
CMD=yes Creates commandline client
WEBSERVER=yes Creates webserver for remote control
ALC=yes Creates aLinkCreator GUI version
ALCC=yes Creates aLinkCreator CLI version
XAS=yes Installs xChat statistic plugin
GEOIP=yes Builds with GeoIP library support (needs GeoIP)
MMAP=yes Uses mmap
OPTIMIZE=no Don't use code optimizations

It was reported that aMule doesn't work very well (or at all) with 
cryptopp 5.6.0, so if you face random crashes in aMule then try downgrading
cryptopp to 5.2.2. Script at SBo can be used for building cryptopp 5.2.2.
