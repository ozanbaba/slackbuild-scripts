aMule is a multiplatform ed2k client, fork of the eMule client, using the
wxWidgets class library. It was originally forked from the xMule project,
which in turn was forked from the lMule project. This is turn was the
first fork of eMule to run nativly on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

This requires wxGTK and cryptopp.

It was reported that aMule doesn't work very well (or at all) with 
cryptopp 5.6.0, so version 5.5.2 is recommended instead (you can build
version 5.2.2 using the same build script for cryptopp-5.6.0).
