ArpON (ARP handler inspection) is a portable handler daemon that make
ARP protocol secure in order to avoid the Man In The Middle (MITM)
attack through ARP Spoofing, ARP Cache Poisoning, ARP Poison Routing
(APR) attacks. It blocks also the derived attacks by it, which Sniffing,
Hijacking, Injection, Filtering & co attacks for more complex derived
attacks, as: DNS Spoofing, WEB Spoofing, Session Hijacking and SSL/TLS
Hijacking & co attacks.  This is possible using three kinds of anti ARP
Spoofing tecniques: the first is based on SARPI or "Static ARP Inspection"
in statically configured networks without DHCP; the second on DARPI or
"Dynamic ARP Inspection" in dinamically configured networks having DHCP;
the third on HARPI or "Hybrid ARP Inspection" in "hybrid" networks, that
is in statically and dynamically (DHCP) configured networks together.
ArpON is therefore a proactive point to point and multipoint based
solution that requires a daemon in every host of the connection and
that doesn't modify the classic ARP standard base protocol by IETF, but
rather sets precise policies by using SARPI for static networks, DARPI
for dynamic networks and HARPI for hybrid networks thus making today's
standardized protocol working and secure from any foreign intrusion.


To start the ArpON at boot, set executable /etc/rc.d/rc.ArpON and add
following code to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.ArpON ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.ArpON start
