Chaplin parses a DVD disc or image and extracts the exact duration for 
each chapter of a given title. Then the total list of chapters is split 
into a user-selectable number of subsets. Each subset should have 
approximately the same duration.

It can create vcdimager xml files for S/VCD mastering as well. It supports
full set of vcdimager capacities and can be used to create nice looking
S/VCDs from DVD disks.

chaplin-genmenu tool needs transcode, ImageMagick and the mjpegtools at
runtime.
