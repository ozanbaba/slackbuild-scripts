# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

cdfs: CDfs (cd filesystem driver)
cdfs: 
cdfs: CDfs is a file system for Linux systems that `exports' all tracks and 
cdfs: boot images on a CD as normal files. These files can then be mounted 
cdfs: (e.g. for ISO and boot images), copied, played (audio and VCD tracks)
cdfs: The primary goal for developing this file system was to "unlock" 
cdfs: information in old ISO images.
