MediaInfo needs libmediainfo which is aviable in SBo.

By default It will install Desktop files of GUI to KDE$'s servic menus, 
If you don't want that, Pass KDE=no to the script.
By default It will build and install both GUI and CLI versions. You can
stop tthe script from building GUI with passing GNU=no and CLI with 
passing CLI=no.
