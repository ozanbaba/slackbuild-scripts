Prelink is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF dynamically 
linked binaries in such a way that the time needed for thedynamic linker to 
perform relocations at startup significantly decreases. Due to fewer relocations,
the run-time memory consumption decreases as well (especially the number of 
unshareable pages). The prelinking information is only used at startup time 
if none of the dependent libraries have changed since prelinking; otherwise 
programs are relocated normally.
