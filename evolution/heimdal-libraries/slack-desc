heimdal-libraries: heimdal-libraries (Heimdal Kerberos 5 Implementation)
heimdal-libraries:
heimdal-libraries: Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5, protocol compatible 
heimdal-libraries: with RFC 4120 and MIT Kerberos V5.  Kerberos is a system for 
heimdal-libraries: authenticating users and services on a network. It is built upon the
heimdal-libraries: assumption that the network is unsafe. For example, data sent over 
heimdal-libraries: the network can be eavesdropped and altered, and addresses can also
heimdal-libraries: be faked. Therefore they cannot be used for authentication purposes.
heimdal-libraries: Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.
