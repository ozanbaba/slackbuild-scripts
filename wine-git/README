Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

This requires fontforge and webcore-fonts.

wine64.SLackBuild will build only wine 64bit

wine.SlackBuild will build only wine 32bit

wow64.SLackBuild will build both wine compat 32bit and 64bit to run both 32bit
      and 64bit programs. 

wine-compat32.SlackBuild will build wine compat 32bit to ggo with wine64. It needs
	  64bit build dir as second argument to work. 

All of the scripts can use MAKEDEP=yes for running make depend before make and
MAKEJOB=n for make -jn.
